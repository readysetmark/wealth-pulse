Wealth Pulse
============

Wealth Pulse is web frontend for a ledger journal file. The ledger journal file is based on the command line [Ledger] journal file format and features double-entry accounting for personal finance tracking.


Objective
---------

Short-term: provide better looking reports and charts via a web frontend.

Long-term: provide better reporting on investments.


Dependencies
------------

Backend
- Clojure 1.5.1
- Instaparse 1.2.16
- Compojure 1.1.6
- Ring-Jetty-Adapter 1.2.1
- Ring-JSON 0.2.0

Frontend
- React 0.9.0-rc1
- Underscore 1.6.0
- Backbone 1.1.1 (routing only)
- D3 3.0.0
- jQuery 2.1.0
- jQuery Hotkeys
- Bootstrap 2.3.1


How to Compile for Deployment
-----------------------------

    lein uberjar


How to Run
----------

Setup a ``LEDGER_FILE`` environment variable that points to your ledger file.

Then run Wealth Pulse using one of the following methods.

### Standalone

    java -jar wealthpulse-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar


### With Source Code

    lein run


### Development

    lein ring server-headless


Command Bar Supported Commands
------------------------------

You can use the '/' hotkey to reach the command bar.

Commands

    Balance:   bal [accounts-to-include] [parameters]

    Register:  reg [accounts-to-include] [parameters]

    Net Worth: nw


Parameters

    :exclude [accounts-to-exclude]

    :period [this month|last month]

    :since [yyyy/mm/dd]

    :upto [yyyy/mm/dd]

    :title [report title]


Implementation Notes
--------------------

Investments & Commodities:

*	I'm basically ignoring these for the moment. The parser will parse them, but all processing after that point assumes one commodity and basically assumes only the "amount" field is used. I'll need to revisit this once I get around to adding investment/commodity support.


Phase 1 Implementation (Reporting)
----------------------

### Objective

*	Replace the ledger bal and reg commandline options with a web interface.
*	Provide some basic reporting like net worth and income vs expenses
*	See http://bugsplat.info/static/stan-demo-report.html for some examples


### First Milestone

Parsing Ledger File
- [x] Basic / optimistic parsing of ledger file
- [x] Autobalance transactions
- [x] Ensure transactions balance (if not autobalanced)

Balance Report
- [x] Single balance report with parameters (filters) and generates JSON data
  - [x] Balance report query
  - [x] Balance report view

Net Worth Chart
- [x] Report to generate JSON data for a networth chart
- [x] Generate "networth" chart from the command bar

Single Page Web App
- [x] Serve static files (css/js)
- [x] "Static" links for balance sheet, net worth, current income, previous income


### Second Milestone

Dynamic Website:
- [x] Setup command bar
- [x] Highlight active page on navlist


### Third Milestone

Register Report
- [x] Register report with parameters (ie accounts, date range)
	- [x] build register report generator function
	- [x] create register report template
	- [x] link up to command bar
	- [x] link to from balance reports
- [x] Accounts Payable vs Accounts Receivable
	- Dynamically list non-zero accounts with balance in navlist. Link to register report


### Fourth Milestone

Setup Runnable App
- [x] Write main
- [x] Watch ledger file and reload on change
- [x] Handle situation where file cannot be parsed

Documentation
- [x] How to use / setup


Phase 2 Implementation (Commodities)
----------------------

Commodity Prices
- [ ] Update to handle commodities
- [ ] Detect investment transactions and merge transaction lines (while continuing to use ledger file format)
- [ ] Identify commodities from ledger file
- [ ] Fetch prices from internet and add to cache
	- [ ] Store commodity prices in a local cache
	- [ ] Prices should go from first date in ledger file to today

Net Worth
- [ ] Update chart with book value line and actual line

Balance Sheet
- [ ] Update Net Worth sheet with actual vs book value columns

Portfolio
- [ ] Overall portfolio return and per investment
- [ ] Expected T3s/T5s to receive for last year (ie had distribution)
- [ ] Rebalancing calculator - for rebalancing investments to proper allocation

Expenses
- [ ] Average in last 3 months, in last year
- [ ] Burn rate - using last 3 months expenses average, how long until savings is gone?
- [ ] Top Expenses over last period

Charts
- [ ] Income Statement chart (monthly, over time)

Nav
- [ ] Configurable nav list
- [ ] Combine reports and payables / receivables into one dict?
- [ ] Default report?


Someday/Maybe
-------------

Other
- [ ] Notification when ajax call is happening?
- [ ] Unit tests

Bugs
- [ ] Parser should fail if there is bogus stuff in file (eg. line with "aaabbc")
  This is a consequence of using regex to pull out transactions
- [x] Every time the handler is reloaded when running in dev mode, a new watcher thread is created
- [ ] ``lein ring server`` development mode still breaks if source code changes and modules are reloaded (web/module-deps is reset)
- [x] Networth chart hover does not work properly in Firefox

Cleanup
- [ ] Revisit parsing with instaparse. Can I get it to work without the regex?
- [ ] Move title/subtitle stuff to frontend?
- [ ] Clean up web.clj (lots of duplication, stuff to be moved elsewhere?)
- [ ] Clean up wealthpulse.js (minimum I can factor out report title)
- [ ] Do I need core.clj? I can create an uberjar with ``lein ring uberjar``
- [ ] Creating lambda/closure function for dismiss for ExceptionBox isn't the best way to go about clearing the exception box

Optimizations
- [ ] Speed up parsing with instaparse?
- [ ] Speed up balance query by filtering accounts first?
- [ ] Speed up networth using custom query?

Command Bar Enhancements
- [ ] Add fault tolerance to parameter parsing
- [ ] Clean up and improve date/period parsing
	Additions for period: yyyy, last year, this year
- [ ] Autocomplete hints (bootstrap typeahead)
